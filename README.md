# Detecting and dissecting anomalous anatomic regions in spatial transcriptomics with STAND
we introduce Spatial Transcriptomics ANomaly Detection (STAND), an innovative computational method capable of integrating multimodal information, 
e.g., spatial gene expression, histology image and single cell gene expression, to not only delineate anomalous tissue regions but also reveal 
their compositional heterogeneities across multi-sample spatial transcriptomics (ST) data.
